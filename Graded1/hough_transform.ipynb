    "The circular Hough Transform can be used to detect circles in edge images. It is very\n",
    "similar to the linear Hough Transform, with the difference that there is one parameter\n",
    "more to take into account: circle radius.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "Assume we are given a pair of an original gray-scale image ```I[y, x]``` and a corresponding\n",
    "edge image ```edge_I[y, x]```, of size $H \\times W$, such that $0 ≤ y < H$ and $0 ≤ x < W$. Every\n",
    "pixel of the edge image has logical value equal to 255 if the corresponding pixel of\n",
    "the original image belongs to an edge, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "In this exercise you are asked to implement a version of Hough transform for detecting\n",
    "circles. A circle can be represented in the following way:\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(x − x_c)^2 + (y − y_c)^2 = r^2, \\hspace{0.5cm} 0 ≤ x_c < W, \\hspace{0.5cm} 0 ≤ y_c < H, \\hspace{0.5cm} \\hspace{0.5cm} (1.1)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "where $(y, x)$ are pixel coordinates in the edge image ```edge_I```, and $(y_c, x_c, r)$ are the\n",
    "parameters of the model corresponding to the y- and x- coordinates of the center of the circle and its radius respectively.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "If the radius of the circle to be found is fixed, then the parameter space is reduced to\n",
    "2-d. Each point $(y, x)$ on the original circle (in the image space) defines a circle centered\n",
    "at $(y, x)$ with radius $r$. The intersection point of all such circles in the\n",
    "parameter space corresponds to the center point $(y_c, x_c)$ of the original circle on the\n",
    "image space. An example is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/hough.png\">\n",
    "Figure 1. In order to find the center of the blue circle, green circles centered at four edge points vote for the blue circle center $(y_c, x_c)$.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "An accumulator matrix is used to find the intersection point in the parameter space. For a fixed radius, the accumulator array is a 2-D matrix, whose\n",
    "    rows and columns correspond to different values of parameters of $y_c$ and $x_c$ respectively. This matrix is filled by passing through every edge point, formulating a circle centered at that point in\n",
    "the parameter space and increasing the voting number of all the cells/pixels through which the new\n",
    "circle passes. The number of “votes” in each element in the accumulator matrix denotes the number of circles in \n",
    "the parameter space that pass through the corresponding cell. \n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "After voting, we compute local maxima of the accumulator array. The positions of these\n",
    "maxima correspond to the circle centers $(y_c, x_c)$ in the original image space.\n"
